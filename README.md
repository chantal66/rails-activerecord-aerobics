# [UNMAINTAINED] Rails ActiveRecord Aerobics
**PLEASE NOTE** This project is abandoned and left here in case its of use to others. Please feel free to start and publish your own fork with your own customizations.

Boost your [Rails ActiveRecord Query](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) core fitness with this workout plan. For the home, office, and gym.

Rails ActiveRecord Aerobics is a collection of exercises to help you learn, practice, and master Rails ActiveRecord Querying. 

This is for all Rails developers of all experience levels. Consult a medical practitioner before beginning a new fitness program.

The exercises build on each other to strengthen your query skills bit-by-bit. Take them as fast or as slow as you like. 

Use common sense and deduction to figure out what code is being asked for, then write it, wherever you encounter `YOUR_CODE_HERE` in the exercises.

If you want a playground of data to experiment and practice with then run `bin/rake db:seed`, followed by `bin/rails c`, and then try out a few queries with the provided data. e.g. `Category.where("name like '%e%'").count` and `Product.all`.

### How do I run the exercises?

1. `git clone git@github.com:eliotsykes/rails-activerecord-aerobics.git`
2. `cd rails-activerecord-aerobics`
3. `bundle install`
4. `bundle binstubs rspec-core`
5. `bin/rake db:migrate` to setup the db
6. `bin/rake gen` to generate exercises in `spec/exercises`
7. `bin/rake go` to begin your aerobics workout
8. The exercise specs in `spec/exercises` will fail. Go in and edit them where it says YOUR_CODE_HERE to make them pass.
9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 until all your exercises pass.
10. Feel the burn.

## Draft Workout Plans (work in progress)

### What to practice?

From `find` to advanced queries using `join`, `includes`. Everything covered in Rails ActiveRecord Querying guide and anything else useful not mentioned. Comb through API docs. 

Don't be too abstract with models, favour classes developers might encounter in a day job.

### How to structure the specs?

First x specs each deal with one topic and a set of tightly related drills using a mix of model families:

1. a01_find_spec
2. a02_find_by_spec
3. a03_find_by_*_spec
4. a04_where_spec
5. ???
9. a09_joins_spec
10. a10_basic_sql_spec
11. a11_advanced_sql_spec

(remember to write exercises for ActiveRecord::Calculations)

Last y specs focus on one family of models each, with exercises that make use of all previously learned skills. Start off with a few finds, then some find_bys, and work up to joins and more, all in one spec file for each model family.

1. b01_book_spec
2. b02_invoice_spec
3. b03_credit_card_spec
4. b04_customer_spec
5. b05_product_spec
6. b06_content_spec
7. b07_user_spec
8. b08_money/account/finance_spec
9. ???
